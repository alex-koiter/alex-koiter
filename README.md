## Who am I?
My Name is Alex Koiter (he/him) and I am an associate professor in the department of Geography and Environment at Brandon University. My academic training is a bit of a mix of environmental science and physical geography (soil science, geomorphology). More recently I have been learning about, actively participating in, and advocating for, open and reproducible science. I recently created my very first R package, [`mbquartR`](https://docs.ropensci.org/mbquartR/), and had it peer-reviewed by [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/). This package helps users find parcels of land based on the legal land description (e.g., NE-22-8-1E1); this system was widely used to georeference soil and other environmental samples prior to the widespread use of GPS.

## What do I do?
### Teaching
I teach a range of courses including geomorphology, soil science, weather & climate, global environmental change, and limnology. Some of my favourite teaching expereinces are the independent or directed study courses where I have the opportunity to work with students one-on-one and develop tailored projects that let them explore their own interests. Where ever possible I try to fit in a little bit of R into my courses so students have the opportunity to learn a little bit of programming üòÅ. I also give [presentations](https://github.com/alex-koiter/presentations) and [guest lectures](https://github.com/alex-koiter/linear_regression), and help deliver workshops on coding in R and how to make science more reproducible and open. 

### Research
My research program focuses on how interactions between land and water management practices and landscape features affect soil and water quality. In particular I am investigated in agri-environmental issues including soil erosion, downstream sedimentation, nutrient dynamics, greenhouse gas fluxes, micro-plastics, and extremes of moisture. I do not do this research in isolation, I have a network of excellent and supportive colleagues across Manitoba, Canada, and globally! Much of the work done is done by a fantastic group of graduate students and undergraduate research assistants. I have also started creating more open and reproducible science by using Quarto Manuscripts. This allows me to integrate the data, code, statistical analysis, results, and text in a single repository. It also produces a user friendly website that allows people to read the published work and dig deeper into the methods using the notebooks. For example, have a look at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alex-koiter/riparian-grazing-manuscript) and the accompanying [website](https://alexkoiter.ca/riparian-grazing-manuscript/) for my recent publication on riparian grazing and phosphorus.

### Service

At Brandon University I currently serve as the coordinator for the [Environmental Science Program](https://www.brandonu.ca/environmental-science/) and I am part of the Strategic Academic Planning Committee.

I am the treasurer of the [International Association for Sediment Water Science](https://www.ufz.de/iasws/) and recently completed a 3-year term on the executive board for the [Manitoba Soil Science Society](https://mbsoils.ca/).

Locally, I am the president of the [Westman Naturalists](https://westman-naturalists.github.io/)
