## Who am I?
My Name is Alex Koiter (he/him) and I am an associate professor in the department of Geography and Environment at Brandon University. My academic training is a bit of a mix of environmental science and physical geography (soil science, geomorphology)! More recently I have been learning about, actively participating in, and advocating for, open and reproducible science. 

## What do I do?
My day job has three main parts:
### Teaching
I teach a range of courses including geomorphology, soil science, weather & climate, global environmental change, and limnology. Some of my favourite teaching expereinces are the independent or directed study courses where I have the opportunity to work with students one-on-one and develop tailored projects that let them explore their own interests. Where ever possible I try to fit in a little bit of R into my courses so students have the opportunity to learn a little bit of programming üòÅ I also give presentations and guest lectures, and help deliver workshops on coding in R and how to make science more reproducible and open. 
### Research
My research program focuses on how interactions between land and water management practices and geomorphology affect soil and water quality. In particular I am investigated in agri-environmental issues including soil erosion, downstream sedimentation, nutrient dynamics, greenhouse gas fluxes, micro-plastics, and extremes of moisture. I do not do this research in isolation, I have a network of excellent and supportive colleagues across Manitoba, Canada, and globally! Much of the work done is done by a fantastic group of graduate students and undergraduate research assistants. 
### Service
I currently serve as the coordinator for the Environmental Science Program
